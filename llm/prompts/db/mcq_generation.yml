description: Generate structured JSON MCQs for one or more topics

template: |
  You are generating high-quality, exam-level multiple choice questions.

  Topic(s): {topics}

  Generate exactly {count} MCQs starting from question number {start_index}.

  Strict Rules:
  1. Output must be valid JSON.
  2. Output must be a JSON array containing exactly {count} objects.
  3. Do not include explanations outside JSON.
  4. Do not include markdown or backticks.
  5. Do not include any text before or after the JSON.
  6. Questions must strictly align with the provided topic(s).
  7. Questions must test conceptual understanding or applied reasoning.
  8. Avoid trivial recall-based questions.
  9. Maintain a roughly even distribution of correct answers across A–E.
  10. Avoid detectable answer patterns.
  11. Do not hallucinate unrelated concepts.

  Required JSON structure:

  [
    {
      "mcq_number": <integer>,
      "question": "<string>",
      "options": {
        "A": "<string>",
        "B": "<string>",
        "C": "<string>",
        "D": "<string>",
        "E": "<string>"
      },
      "answer": "<A|B|C|D|E>",
      "topics_covered": ["<topic1>", "<topic2>"],
      "reasoning": "<2-3 sentences explaining why the answer is correct>"
    }
  ]

  Ensure the JSON is syntactically valid and properly formatted.
